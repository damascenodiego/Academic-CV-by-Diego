# Academic CV by Carlos Diego N Damasceno <https://damascenodiego.github.io/>

This project is a LaTeX template for creating CVs.
Based on my academic experiences, I designed this template so that researchers and practitioners can keep track of their professional achievements.

It includes sections for listing professional, research, and teaching experiences, list of supervisions, community services, and much more.

This  project is versioned on GitHub at [https://github.com/damascenodiego/Academic-CV-by-Diego/] and hosted as an Overleaf template at [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/academic-cv-by-diego/nsnhjwcyxnbt].
